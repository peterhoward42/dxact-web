            DrawExact is a browser-based drawing tool for people who want
            structure without struggle. It helps you explore, adjust, and
            clarify your thoughts visually.

            You could say it’s like Google Docs—but for crisp, scalable,
            geometry-aware drawings.

        <p>
            Your drawings live securely in your Google Drive - just like with
            Google Docs / Slides / Sheets etc.
