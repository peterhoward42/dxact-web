            DrawExact is a browser-based drawing tool for people who want
            structure without struggle. It helps you explore, adjust, and
            clarify your thoughts visually — without noise or clutter.

            It works with your Google Drive, so your drawings live right
            alongside your documents. But unlike <em>Docs</em> or
            <em>Slides</em>, <strong>you choose when to save</strong> — so you can
            try bold changes, undo freely, and only commit when it’s right.

            This isn’t a sketchpad or a toy. It’s a geometry-aware workspace
            built to support real ideas — and to let you shape them, reshape
            them, and stay in control.
