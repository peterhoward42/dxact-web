            CAD excels helping you design real things - asking you to think in
            3D. DrawExact supports you in thinking and riffing with Lines, Arcs
            and Text, thinking in 2D

            Adobe's products require complexity to satisfy both people with an
            artistic drawing intent and people who want to make more technical
            drawings. DrawExact keeps things simple, by unapologetically
            targeting technical drawing.
