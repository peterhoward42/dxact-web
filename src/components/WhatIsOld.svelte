            You have to think deeply to compose drawings. DrawExact is your
            quietly competent, unobtrustive partner — freeing you to think.

            It's kinda <em>Google Docs</em> reimagined for geometrically precise
            drawings (rather than documents).

        <p>
            Instead of thinking it knows where a line should go <em
                >(like Powerpoint)</em
            >, <strong>you</strong> are in control.
        </p>
        <p>
            Like <em>Docs</em>, it works in your browser, uses Google Sign-In,
            saves to Google Drive, and is free.
        </p>
        <p>
            Google encourages <em>third-party Google Workspace Apps</em> — that's
            what DrawExact is.
