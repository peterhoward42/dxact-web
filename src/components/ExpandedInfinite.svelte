            drawings what measurement units feel natural. For the boat in some
            of our examples, the natural units were mm. That's what we were
            thinking when we drew it, and we entered coordinates to draw it in
            mm.</span

        <span

            example. Just go ahead and set lengths and distances to the right
            values in feet. The coordinate readouts and automatic dimensioning
            don't know about units. They just show the <strong
